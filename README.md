## Chirp! 
# A small project to let me live my best life and sing the songs I'm listening to. 

This project is intended to show you the lyrics to the song you are listening to on Spotify. 

It uses: 
Spotify & Genius APIs (Spotify doesn't have real time updates, so I will need to refresh the page for now.) 
Currently, it just pulls in the song you are listening to and displays the song and artist name. 

Next steps are to implement searching for the song on Genius, and then pulling in the lyrics for the song.

Then, I will make the front end pretty by making designs and maybe designing a small logo. 

Chirp, chirp!
